Hi, I’m Raven! Nice to meet you!
I’m interested in writing, game development, algorithmic bias, and many other things I pick up here and there.
Most of my interests fall outside of what's relevant here, as of now, but I hope I can incorporate what I love
in my work some day. 
I'm still really new to learning, well, everything. But I'm not new to the great creations of this place!

I hope I can learn much from everyone!
